# An empty or single character or group of characters
# In python, strings are specified with in single quote('') or double quotes (" ") or triple quotes (''' ''') or (""" """)

# Comments are represented by # symbol or triple quotes (''' ''')

#EXAMPLE

a = 5 #first variable
b = 7 #second variable
c = a + b
'''Above code is adding two numbers a and b and storing the result in variable c.'''
#comments translates hote hai but execute nhi hote hai, so they are used to explain the code and make it more readable for humans.

a = '5' # string with length 1
b = "7" # string with length 1
c = a + b # string concatenation
print(c) # 57 (Here, the + operator is used for string concatenation, which means it combines the two strings a and b together to form a new string "57". 


#EXAMPLE 2

a = "Gate"
b = 5

# c = a+b # Error, b is integer
d = a*b

# print(d)

e = '5'
c = a+e # c = "Gate5" (Here, the + operator is used for string concatenation, which means it combines the string a and e together to form a new string "Gate5".
